# Constructor-Word-Guess

In this version of Hangman, the command line terminal was used to play out the game. The game is initiated using node.js. This used NPM's inquirer, random-word, and is-letter packages. Two javascript constructors were also used. To keep the game going, a recursive function was used under index.js. This was done using three different javascript files. The logic was done inside index.js. The constructors are in letter.js and Word.js. The instructions are in instructions.md. To start the game, the user uses node on the index.js file. This will start the game. If the user tries to guess something besides a letter, a validate function in the inquirer npm will reject the input and prompt for another input. Once the game is complete, a new word will appear. The guesses left depend on the length of the word. Guesses are decreased only if user guesses wrong word. If all guesses are used, the game ends and the the program stops. Packages would need to be downloaded from npm to play. Dependencies are in package.json.
